## How AutoYield Works

Your collateral should work for you, even when you're not trading.

Most exchanges treat your margin as dead capital. It sits there backing your position, doing nothing.

At RISEx, idle collateral is automatically deployed to low-risk DeFi strategies, earning yield while still available for trading.

## Key Features

### Automatic

No action required. Yield accrues by default.

### No Lock-up

Your collateral remains fully available for trading or withdrawal.

### Risk-Managed

Only low-risk, battle-tested strategies are used.

## How It's Possible

AutoYield only works because RISEx is synchronously composable with DeFi.

Your collateral can simultaneously:

* Back your trading positions
* Earn yield in lending protocols
* Be withdrawn instantly

This is impossible on isolated exchanges. It's native to RISEx.
